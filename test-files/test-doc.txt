RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Technology Overview

RAG is a powerful AI technique that combines the strengths of pre-trained language models with external knowledge retrieval. This approach enhances the model's ability to provide accurate, up-to-date, and contextually relevant responses.

Key Components:
1. Knowledge Base: A collection of documents, articles, or data sources
2. Retrieval System: Searches for relevant information based on user queries
3. Generation Model: Creates responses using both retrieved context and model knowledge

Benefits of RAG:
- Improved accuracy through access to specific domain knowledge
- Reduced hallucinations by grounding responses in factual data
- Dynamic knowledge updates without retraining the model
- Better handling of specialized or recent information

Use Cases:
- Customer support systems with access to product documentation
- Research assistants with scientific paper databases
- Legal advisors with case law repositories
- Medical diagnosis support with clinical literature
